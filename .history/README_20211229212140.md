# garden-scala-hot-reload

This example shows how you can hot reload a Scala application with Garden and `sbt-revolver`.

The `hot-reload-test` module contains the Scala application, which is created from the `http4s` quick start guide (by running `sbt new http4s/http4s.g8 -b 0.21`).

The Garden module is configured to run `sbt ~reStart` instead of the normal `sbt run` command when in _dev mode_, in order to enable hot reloading, and to sync the `src` directory. You could also sync the `.sbt`Â configuration files, but we omitted that from the example.
